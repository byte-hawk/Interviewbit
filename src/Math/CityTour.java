/*
There are A cities numbered from 1 to A. You have already visited M cities, the indices of which are given in an array B of M integers.

If a city with index i is visited, you can visit either the city with index i-1 (i >= 2) or the city with index i+1 (i < A) if they are not already visited.
Eg: if N = 5 and array M consists of [3, 4], then in the first level of moves, you can either visit 2 or 5.

You keep visiting cities in this fashion until all the cities are not visited.
Find the number of ways in which you can visit all the cities modulo 10^9+7.

Input Format

The 1st argument given is an integer A, i.e total number of cities.
The 2nd argument given is an integer array B, where B[i] denotes ith city you already visited.
Output Format

Return an Integer X % (1e9 + 7), number of ways in which you can visit all the cities.
Constraints

1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= M <= A
1 <= B[i] <= A
For Example

Input:
    A = 5
    B = [2, 5]
Output:
    6

Explanation:
    All possible ways to visit remaining cities are :
    1. 1 -> 3 -> 4
    2. 1 -> 4 -> 3
    3. 3 -> 1 -> 4
    4. 3 -> 4 -> 1
    5. 4 -> 1 -> 3
    6. 4 -> 3 -> 1
