/*
Grid Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked ‘Start’ in the diagram below).

Path Sum: Example 1

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.

Example :

Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
